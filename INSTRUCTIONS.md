# Instructions

Below are instructions for implementing some aspects of the Github workflow as we explore the code and data associated with 
[Beyond Linear Regression](https://journals.aps.org/prper/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.15.020110) by Theobald et al.

1. Create a branch called `USERNAME-set-up` (e.g., `cfcraig-set-up`)
2. Create a folder called `USERNAME-work`
3. Copy the code and data files for binomial and logistic regression into your new folder.
4. Create a new pull request to have the changes you made on your branch pulled into the main branch.


testing the pull request template in test branch!
